# Vision and Values

## Our Vision

Our vision is 20/20. Enough said.

## Our Values

### Be Responsible

Just pretend that there's something about why this is important to the company.

### Be Reasonable

This is all setup for the third one.

### B-Real

Ever heard of Cypress Hill? That's the MC's name. No really. Actually saw him live with Prophets of Rage, that was some good stuff.
